This is a little page to make my name score high on the PageRank™️ (is that still a thing? Is Google still relevant?) algorithm.

Anyway, if you are here, you better head to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrolaguna/">LinkedIn</a> profile if you are interested on those things.

If you want to send me an email, get the subdomain, put an <code>@</code> and finally use the root domain. That will get you to my inbox.
