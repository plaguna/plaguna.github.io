Or... not? I do not have a way to know if you are reading this, as there's no comments, no tracking, no nothing. Just plain text that I will type (mostly, don't exclude some AI shenanigans at some point) and I will send it to the void of Internet.

Schedule will be unscheduled. Content will not be security always. Even the quality will be questionable at times.

Just like tapas, this blog will be better consumed in small bites, while you sip a drink and maybe share it with friends?
